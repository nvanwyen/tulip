    static let total_depravity = "The doctrine of total depravity reflects the Reformed viewpoint of original sin. That term, original sin, is often misunderstood in the popular arena. Some people assume that the term original sin must refer to the first sin—the original transgression that we’ve all copied in many different ways in our own lives, that is, the first sin of Adam and Eve. But that’s not what original sin has referred to historically in the church. Rather, the doctrine of original sin defines the consequences to the human race because of that first sin."

    static let unconditional_election = "The Reformed view of election, known as unconditional election, means that God does not foresee an action or condition on our part that induces Him to save us. Rather, election rests on God’s sovereign decision to save whomever He is pleased to save."

    static let limited_atonement = "Limited atonement communicates that God the Father designed the work of redemption specifically with a view to providing salvation for the elect, and that Christ died for His sheep and laid down His life for those the Father had given to Him."

    static let irresistible_grace = "In historic Reformation thought, the notion is this: regeneration precedes faith. We also believe that regeneration is monergistic, which means  that the divine operation called rebirth or regeneration is the work of God alone. The work of regeneration in the human heart is something that God does by His power alone — not by anything of man's power. It is 100 percent the work of God. He, and He alone, has the power to change the disposition of the soul and the human heart to bring us to faith."

    static let perseverance_of_the_saints = "The promise of God that what He starts in our souls, He intends to finish. So the old axiom in Reformed theology about the perseverance of the saints is this: If you have it—that is, if you have genuine faith and are in a state of saving grace—you will never lose it. If you lose it, you never had it."
